# ‚úçÔ∏è Signature Verification DL Prototype

A local deep learning pipeline for signature verification, designed for research, education, and safe experimentation.  
This experiment is part of my [Data Science Lab](https://github.com/LunAI-dev/data-science-lab); a playground of applied ML and DL experiments where chaos meets logic.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Project Overview

In real-world scenarios, signature data is **sensitive and legally protected**.  

How can we explore advanced signature verification without exposing real signatures?  
Can we develop architectures combining ResNet, DenseNet, and attention mechanisms purely for research purposes?  
What design balances **learning robustness, augmentation strategies, and modularity** while remaining fully safe for public release?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚Äî Why no notebook / pretrained weights are provided ?

This repository intentionally **does not** include any real signature dataset, pretrained weights, or a downloadable notebook containing a ready-to-run production model. The reasons are deliberate and twofold:

- **Risk of misuse:** A powerful, ready-to-use signature verification model can be abused. Even if not perfect, such a model could be leveraged by malicious actors to aid in signature forgery or other fraudulent activities. For this reason we do not publish pretrained models or any artifacts that would materially lower the barrier to misuse.

- **Data privacy & legal constraints:** Signature images are often personally identifiable information and are frequently covered by legal restrictions, NDAs, or institutional policies. Publishing or linking real signature datasets would violate privacy and possibly legal obligations.

Instead, this repository provides a **safe, fully documented template**: architecture definitions, pipeline code, augmentation recipes, and demo code that runs with **synthetic placeholder data**. If you wish to reproduce experiments with real data, you must obtain and preprocess your own legally and ethically sourced dataset; follow institutional and legal guidelines.

If you want, I can also:
- produce a `LICENSE` suggestion (MIT / BSD / custom non-commercial wording),  
- add starter badges (python version, license),  
- or generate a lightweight demo notebook that runs end-to-end on synthetic data and is safe to publish.
